# SequelizedBurger
A full stack burger-logger app. On the server side this app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate HTML. this app also follows the MVC design pattern and use Sequelize to interact with the database. On the client side uses Bootstrap for layout and style, and JQuery to validate user input.

## How it works
- SequelizedBurger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and the name of the customer.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also an input to enter the name of the customer and a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
